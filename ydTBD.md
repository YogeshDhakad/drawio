We are impressed with the following features:
a) Ability to work with multiple storage options: Local, GDrive, many others => REALLY USEFUL.
b) AutoSave option: I was SHOCKED to see this working very well with Local drive on my computer.
- I am in the browser and file location is D:\_Win72Win10_\C___DELETE__\Proj - YD-10Devs\Intership-Product\Employer_Oct2020\flowChart.drawio
- How is the AutoSave working. @YD we need to study this. I am really impressed with this.
c) AutoSave option working with GDrive and other storage platforms will be equally interesting to study.
